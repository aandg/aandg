## Ceremony

The ceremony will take place on May 16 at the [Basilique Saint-Martin d'Ainay (Basilica of Saint-Martin d'Ainay)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Saint-Martin_d%27Ainay) in the historic center of Lyon.

This is the only remaining Roman church in Lyon from the end of the 11th century, and is built on the site of a 4th century Benedictine abbey.

## Reception

The reception will take place afterwards at [**Le Château du Pin, 600 Chemin de la Ronze, 69480 Morancé, France**](https://www.lechateaudupin.fr/).

The private estate is less than 20 kilometers northwest of Lyon, nestled in the Beaujolais wine region.

The Château is steeped in history, with the original building constructed by the Chana family in 1100 (around the same time as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris) and its keep was constructed later in 1311.
