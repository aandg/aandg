## Arriving by Air

[**Lyon–Saint Exupéry Airport (LYS)**](https://www.airport-lyon.com/) is Lyon’s international airport, located 20 km / 13 miles southeast of the city center.

### Travelers from North America

For those looking to fly directly to Lyon from North America, Air Canada/Air Transat are the only airline to offer a direct flight from Montréal. 

However, most flights will require a layover somewhere in Europe prior to Lyon. 

We recommend that you connect in the following airports (ranked, with the airline bringing you to Lyon), based on our experience to transfer into the Schengen area of the EU:

* Zürich (ZRH) - Swiss
* Munich (MUC) - Lufthansa
* Amsterdam (AMS) - KLM

Other options, alphabetically listed:
* Brussels (BRU) - Brussels Airlines
* Dublin (DUB) - Aer Lingus
* Frankfurt (FRA) - Lufthansa
* London Heathrow (LHR) - British Airways
* Lisbon (LIS) - TAP Portugal
* Madrid (MAD) - Iberia
* Vienna (VIE) - Austrian Airlines

We do **NOT** recommend connecting through:
* Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) - **exception, unless you take the TGV to Lyon
* Düsseldorf (DUS) - We do not recommend this for North American travelers, since we cannot recommend that you take a long-haul Eurowings flight. 

### Travelers from Europe

Air France serves most airports in France and major European airports. 

EasyJet serves a number of destinations in Europe (including London, Berlin, Brussels, Rome, Edinburgh and Madrid) along with a few domestic destinations which are not easily reached by train (Bordeaux, Toulouse, Nice). 

Most other major European airlines also operate flights between Lyon and their respective hubs.

### From LYS to Lyon (and back)

#### Taxi

A taxi to Lyon costs around €50-80 depending on the exact destination and time of day, so if you are a group of four people this could be an option. Taxis are available at the taxi rank outside Terminal 1 (follow the signs). 

#### Car-Sharing Apps

Uber/Lyft do not work in Lyon (pretty sure).

#### Public Transport

[The Rhône Express](https://www.rhonexpress.fr/en) is a cheaper option.
 
The connection between Lyon city center and the airport has been improved by the opening of a "tram-train" line called Rhônexpress. It is faster (30 min) and more reliable than the old buses (which no longer run), 
but it is definitely aimed at business travellers given the upscale onboard service for a tram (including free wifi and power sockets at each seat) and the high price: €15.90 (as of 2017) for a single journey, 
€27.50 for a return (add €1 to purchase on board). It is slightly cheaper if you purchase the ticket online (€14.70 one-way and €25.90 return). If you purchase a return ticket online at least 1 or 2 months in advance, 
a greater discount is available. 

The Rhônexpress connects in the city at the main Lyon Part-Dieu station, in addition to connecting with the metro (line A) at Vaulx-en-Velin La Soie (second stop), which is convenient if you are staying in 
Presqu'île or Villeurbanne. Trains run from 5h00 to 24h00 (midnight) and depart every 15 (6AM-9PM) to 30 min. 

To find them, follow the red signs in the airport terminals. You have to walk through the TGV station, which can be as long as 10 minutes if you arrive at Terminal 3 (which is served low-cost airlines).

It’s kind of slow though...

#### Rent a Car

This is, of course, an option.

## Arriving by Train

### From Geneva

It is possible to take the train from Geneva

If you fly to Geneva: You can take the train from Geneva Airport to the main railway station in Geneva (Cornavin) free of charge by picking up a [complimentary ticket](https://www.gva.ch/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-67/) in the baggage reclaim area, 
and then take a train from Cornavin to Lyon. The journey takes around 2.5 hours.

Genève Aéroport offers passengers on arrival a free ticket to use public transport in Geneva during 80 minutes, including the journey by train Genève-Aéroport - Geneva-Cornavin. It can be picked-up from the machine in the baggage reclaim area (Arrivals).

All trains departing from / going to Genève-Aéroport station stop in the City Center of Geneva in Geneva-Cornavin station (7-minute trip between the two stations, up to seven trains per hour at peak hours).

Departing from / going to the Geneva-Cornavin station, many direct TER/TGV trains serve most of the cities of the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region (Aix-les-Bains, Bourg-en-Bresse, Chambéry Grenoble, Lyon, Valence, etc.), as well as the TGV to Paris and Marseille.

From 15 December 2019, new “Léman Express” connections will serve more than 45 train stations in Switzerland and in France, including the French cities (Annecy, Annemasse, Bonneville, Cluses, Evian, St-Gervais-les-Bains-Le-Fayet) departing from/going to the Geneva-Cornavin station.

### From Paris CDG

You can take a TGV (high-speed train) directly from the railway station which is adjacent to Terminal 2 (station name: Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV or Paris Aéroport Roissy Charles-de-Gaulle when booking online) to Lyon Part Dieu station. In some cases, this makes the journey faster and more convenient (no need to go from Lyon Saint-Exupéry Airport to Lyon city centre). Trains run every hour or so; be sure to buy an exchangeable ticket to be able to catch the first available train after you land. The low-cost train company OUIGO [105] also operates train services between CDG railway station and Lyon Part Dieu station.
