Beyond these options, we can help you pick a neighborhood in which to stay in the city center:

### Presqu’île

Enclosed by the Saône and Rhône rivers, this rocky peninsula (presqu'île) is where the heart of Lyon beats. Be it shopping on Saturdays, going out to a traditional bouchon restaurant or theatre in the evenings, or participating in the town's events, everything happens here. It is a place of contrast where the heritage of historical museums rubs shoulders with the bold architecture of the resolutely modern Confluence quarter, a showcase of the town in the 21st Century.

### St. Jean/Vieux Lyon

Vieux Lyon, or Old Lyon, is the city's renaissance district located in the 5th arrondissement. Here, visitors will find many attractions, such as the Place du Change, the former business square of the city, and Rue St-Jean, a popular place to walk – partly for its traboules (secret pathways and staircases that pass through buildings). It's believed that these passageways date back to the fourth century, when residents needed a way to get from their homes to the river (their source of fresh water) without having to weave through the town's winding streets. They were later used by the silk trade and then by the resistance during World War II.

For guests from out of town without a car, a shuttle service will be provided from Lyon to the reception at Le Château du Pin. In the late evening, there will be shuttle service provided from the reception at Le Château du Pin to two central stops in Lyon:
- Place Bellecour
- TBA, depending on guests hotels’ choices
